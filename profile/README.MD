# HighOrder / 高阶开发

HighOrder is a platform that includes the Hola language, which describes the system in a very high level, the Hola execution engine and editor, and other tools to improve the efficiency of software development by 10X-100X or more. The Hola language lets the developer not describe about the details of code deployment and data storage, but rather describes the interface, process and logic of the product, and then runs it directly.Developers, product managers and relevant business people can easily learn and use it.

Features:
* Instant development, instant run. Every time you make a change, you can immediately see the effect of actual running, not simulated. What you see is what you get.
* Support Android, iOS, desktop, web, applets and other platforms
* No need to deployment to publish the program
* Hola can be shared and modified， whichi will increase the efficiency by 10X, and the overall development efficiency will reach 100X


Compared to Low-Code/No-Code platforms:
* Not only can develop business and information system software, but also can develop any type of software, including internet apps, puzzle and casual games, hardware monitoring and control software, etc.
* Provides Hola language for sharing and collaboration.
* Develop software with a more user-friendly interface.
* Support customized themes


高阶开发（HighOrder）是包含了在更高维度描述系统的Hola语言，Hola执行引擎和编辑器等等工具组成的平台，目的是将软件开发的效率提高10X-100X以上。Hola语言让开发者不用考虑代码部署，数据存储等细节，直接描述产品的界面，流程和逻辑，然后直接运行。 开发者，产品经理和相关的业务人员都可以容易掌握并时使用。

特征：
* 即时开发，即时运行。每次修改，都能立刻看到运行效果，不是模拟的效果。真正做到所见及所得
* 同时支持Android，iOS，桌面，web，小程序等多个平台
* 不需要通过部署流程就能发布程序
* 可以通过二次分享和修改，再将开发效率提高10X，总体开发效率将达到100X


与低代码/无代码平台相比：
* 不仅仅开发商业和信息系统软件，可以开发任意类型软件，包括互联网App，益智和休闲游戏，硬件监控和操控软件等
* 提供Hola语言，可以进行二次分享和协作
* 开发的软件界面更符合人性化设计
* 提供自定义主题
